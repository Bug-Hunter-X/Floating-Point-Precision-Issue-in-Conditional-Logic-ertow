# Floating Point Precision Issue in Julia

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to floating-point precision in Julia's conditional logic. The `myfunction` function is designed to return the square of a positive number and 0 for non-positive numbers. However, due to how floating-point numbers are represented, very small negative numbers might produce unexpected results.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when comparing floating-point numbers for equality or inequality.  Due to the inherent limitations of floating-point precision, a number that is theoretically greater than zero might be represented internally as a slightly negative value. This can lead to the `if x > 0` condition being incorrectly evaluated as false, resulting in the function returning 0 instead of the expected positive result.

## Solution

The best way to address this is to avoid direct comparison with zero for floating point numbers. Instead, define a tolerance to compare within to avoid floating point inaccuracies and account for potential rounding errors.
